# myITDepartmentApp React.js App by Luis G.

This is a final project submission, 
to build a react website/recreating my college IT department Website. This project was bootstrapped with React.js
Creating a Home page, About us, Programs, Faculty and Contact us page with call to action, with User friendly interface & Professional 
Look and feel. Programing this site to adapt to any device making it fully responsive and display correctly on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. 
Used appropriate layout techniques (flexbox, grid) to create flexible and adaptable layouts, Employing media queries effectively to adjust content and styles based on screen size.
Used React Hooks to manage state and side effects in functional components. Prioritizing a clear and intuitive navigation with the use of use appropriate typography and color schemes.
Optimized for accessibility and fast loading times.

# Report: Redesigning My College IT Department Website with React.js and Node.js

## Project Overview
The project involved redesigning the IT department website for my college using **React.js** for the frontend and **Node.js** for the backend. The primary goal was to modernize the websiteâ€™s design, improve its functionality, and provide an intuitive user experience.

---

#### Design Decisions

1. **Framework and Tools**  
   - React.js was chosen for its component-based architecture and ease of scalability.  
   - Node.js served as the backend for handling API requests and data management.

2. **Page Layout and Navigation**  
   - A minimalist design was implemented, prioritizing clean layouts and intuitive navigation.  
   - A dynamic **navbar** with routing links ensured seamless page transitions without reloads.

3. **Component Hierarchy**  
   - Each major section of the site, such as "About Us," "Services," and "Contact," was divided into reusable components.  
   - Component reusability reduced redundancy and streamlined development.

4. **Routing**  
   - React Router was used for managing routes between pages.  
   - Dynamic routing ensured the website could easily accommodate new pages in the future.

#### Challenges Faced and Solutions

1. **Learning React Fundamentals**  
   - Initially, understanding Reactâ€™s state management, props, and component lifecycle posed difficulties.  
   - Solution: Followed Reactâ€™s official documentation and completed tutorials to grasp these concepts.

2. **Implementing Routing**  
   - Setting up routing with React Router required learning how to define routes and create links.  
   - Solution: Experimented with small examples and integrated routes incrementally. Debugging was key to understanding route mismatches.

3. **Styling Components**  
   - Maintaining consistent styling across components proved tricky due to Reactâ€™s scoped styling and differences from traditional CSS.  
   - Solution: Used CSS modules and practiced applying inline styles for specific elements.  

4. **Integrating Backend with Node.js**  
   - Ensuring communication between the React frontend and Node.js backend required learning about RESTful APIs.  
   - Solution: Studied examples of Express.js for building APIs and tested endpoints thoroughly with tools like Postman.

5. **State Management**  
   - Managing global state across components was initially overwhelming.  
   - Solution: Introduced a context provider to handle global states efficiently.

#### Lessons Learned
- Breaking down problems into smaller tasks greatly simplified the learning process.  
- Documenting issues and solutions along the way helped track progress and avoid repeated mistakes.  
- Understanding the core concepts of React, such as component hierarchy and state management, made future development more efficient.

#### Conclusion
The project was both a learning experience and a significant achievement. Overcoming the initial challenges in React.js and Node.js not only enhanced my technical skills but also strengthened my confidence in building dynamic, responsive websites.
